Procurement report
Hello family, I am delighted to share some fascinating discoveries from my latest exploration of this procurement dataset of 2021 👨‍👩‍👧 🔢 📈 📉 

📊 Our deep dive into the data has uncovered a notable trend where about 1.2billion was approved in the 4th quarter of 2018, making it the highest in procurement expenditure. Also, in the 1st quarter of 2016, about 100million was approved for the procurement. The Marketing department spearheaded with the maximum number of requests initiated and approved. The data shows that procurement department has the lowest number of requests.
🗺 Geographical patterns in procurement are always crucial, Nigeria emerges as undeniable frontrunner in this regard, shadowed by Cameroon and with Congo coming last in the line. It is observed that most requests were received in April of every year and the least of
requests is received in December. These insights will guide our efforts to tailor our resources to country where and when it is needed it the most.
📋 For effective and efficient decision making of the overall organization, the following are recommended;
·       All New Requests of 2021 should be processed.
·       All denied and Cancel requests to be revisited aligning every request to procurement framework, with effect for future requests.
·       Since Marketing department tops the chart, there should be increasingly massive sales (particularly in Nigeria and Cameroon) to balance inputs for outputs.
·       Also, we expect to see massive sale in the second quarter of 2022.
·       Abderzak FatimaZahra should be on the radar because the requests from her department should have a seismic effect on the company's sales and turnover.
·       Statistically, demographic data variable like Gender, Age and Designation of requests initiator should be part of data collection elements.
